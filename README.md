# Small-Python-Projects
## Explanation of files:

The "Cover_Letter_Auto_Filler_Plus_PDF_Converter.py" is a file takes a template cover letter in a word doc format, and replaces the fields listed for what you enter. For example, company name, position, address while be filled out by you. The weakness to this is that you need the information available on hand, but this is still a good way of automating cover letter creation. The program then converts the files to PDF format and gives you the option of combining them. To use this, just download the Python file into the same folder, and make sure you fill in the code with the file paths.

There is a metric/imperial measurements converter that I made so I can convert clothing sizes.

The other Python files are small games that I created as part of the "Automating the Boring Stuff" book activities. Feel free to take a look.
